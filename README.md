# TLDR
6+ years building SPA with React. 1+ year in OTT. Data and Analytics enthusiast.

# Short Bio
I am a Front-end developer working professionally for around 6 years. I started my career at a time when React was getting popular. Having taught myself enough JavaScript, I found many opportunities to work on single page web applications. I continued specializing in single page web application development in React while exploring various industries. Currently I have developed a keen interest in the OTT space where I am learning a lot while having a lot of fun.

Apart from that I have a passion for data and analytics. I know enough Python and R to be dangerous and spend some of my free time learning data analysis with various tools such as spreadsheets, SQL etc.

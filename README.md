# Short Bio
Hi 👋🏾! I’m Imtiaz. You can also call me Sk(/ɛs keɪ/).

I care about building technology that is not only impactful, but also secure, ethical, and sustainable. I broke into tech a decade ago as a self-taught developer. Over the years, I have built significant technical depth and breadth in software engineering and web technologies. My passion for solving complex puzzles and creating lasting impact now drives me to transition into cybersecurity. My journey so far has given me:
- Hands-on SDLC experience across startups and scale-ups in Europe, the US, and Bangladesh.
- Deep technical skills in JavaScript, Python, and modern web technologies, with practical expertise in cloud and automation.
- Proven ability to design, deploy, and optimize large-scale applications for web, OTT, and CTV platforms.
- Strong foundation in product development, data analytics, and business-driven decision-making.

I am deeply grateful to the tech community, and alongside my technical work, I:
- Mentor engineers and newcomers, helping them navigate career transitions.
- Contribute to tech communities through events, volunteering, and writing.
- Advocate for physical and mental wellbeing as essential to long-term success.
- Practice continuous learning with a growth mindset, embracing challenges as opportunities.

At this stage, my focus is on bridging my engineering depth with application security to help teams build products that are not only scalable and resilient, but truly trustworthy.

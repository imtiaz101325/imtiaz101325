# Short Bio
I am a Front-end developer working professionally for around 7 years. I started my career at a time when React was getting popular. Having taught myself enough JavaScript, I found many opportunities to work on single page web applications. I continued specializing in single page web application development in React while exploring various industries. I and now in the OTT and CTV space where I am learning a lot while having a lot of fun.

Apart from that I have a passion for data and analytics. I know enough Python and R to be dangerous and spend some of my free time learning data analysis with various tools.

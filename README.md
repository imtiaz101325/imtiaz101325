# Short Bio
Hi 👋🏾! I’m Imtiaz. You can also call me Sk.

I am a Front-end developer working professionally for around 7 years. I started my career at a time when React was getting popular. Having taught myself enough JavaScript, I found many opportunities to work on single page web applications. I continued specializing in single page web application development in React while exploring various industries. I settled for the OTT and CTV space  for a while building streaming services for various platforms. Now I am interested in Cybersecurity and looking into working on Web Application Security.

Apart from that I have a passion for data and analytics. I know enough Python and R to be dangerous and spend some of my free time learning data analysis with various tools.

I like to read Japanese Manga at my spare time.
